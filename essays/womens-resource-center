When walking around campus, it's easy to accept that the space around us just _is_, or _is as it should be_. But the history of the campus tells a different story.

A campus history helps foster a sense of identity and belonging among students, faculty, and alumni. By understanding the events, people, and traditions that shaped their institution, members of the campus community feel more connected to the place they share. This sense of continuity builds pride and encourages a deeper appreciation for the unique culture of the school.

Learning about campus history also provides valuable lessons about resilience, progress, and change. Colleges and universities often reflect larger social movements and historical moments, and by examining how a campus responded to challenges or milestones, students gain perspective on how past actions influence the present. It helps them recognize their own role in continuing to shape the future of their community.

Finally, preserving and sharing campus history enhances the school’s public image and reputation. A rich, well-documented history can attract prospective students, faculty, and donors who are drawn to a place with a meaningful story. It adds depth to the institution’s character and ensures that important achievements, struggles, and traditions are remembered and celebrated.
